   *

   * will be filled in with default values. The path then is wrapped with vinyl,
   * passed through the roots output path generator, and the file is written.

   * override and there was a compile, otherwise any extensions are preserved as
   * is.
   *

   * to happen. First, the sourcemap needs to be written with a .map extension.
   * Second, the output file needs to get a source mapping url comment so that
   * it knows where the sourcemap is. Both of these things happen as well in
   * this method.

   * - compile options: options that persist through each time the project
   *   compiles, but are cleared between one compile and the next
